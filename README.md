# Insurance policy Holders Analysis
## My Project Review
The analysis was conducted with the understanding that I am tasked with reviewing hospital records of policyholders on behalf of an insurance company, and presenting informed insights derived from the data.
## Data Sources
The main dataset utilized for this analysis is the Hospital csv file that includes comprehensive information about the demographic characteristics of patients who visit a specific Hospital and the specific health conditions they are experiencing.
