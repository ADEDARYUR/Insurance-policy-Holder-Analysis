# Policy-Holder-Analysis
My analysis was conducted under the assumption that I am employed by an insurance company to review hospital records of policyholders and provide insights based on the data.
a. I transformed the values from some columns from “0 an 1” to “yes or no”, columns like diabetes, hypertensions etc to better help my analysis
b. Transformed the value in the gender Colunm to state either “male or female”
c. Wrote a Dax expression to extract the number of females from male policy holders
d. Created a conditional Colum to find the relative similarities and differences between 2 or more diseases among the policy holders, according to gender
e. Created a “fictional targe age” to utilize as the kpi indictaor for the average age of the policy holders
f. Finally included my recommendations to the board.
