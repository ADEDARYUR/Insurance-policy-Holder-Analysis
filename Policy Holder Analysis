# Policy-Holder-Analysis
My analysis was conducted under the assumption that I am employed by an insurance company to review hospital records of their policyholders and provide insights based on the data.
 I transformed the values from some columns from “0 or 1” to a “yes or no” to better help provide insights
 Transformed the value in the gender Colunm to state either “male or female”
 Wrote a Dax expression to extract the number of females from male policyholders
 Created a conditional Colunm to find the relative similarities and differences between 2 or more diseases among the policyholders, according to gender
 Implemented a benchmark age for assessing the average age of policyholders as a key performance indicator.
 Presented suggestions for the organization to consider implementing.
